  },
  {
    question: "What’s the difference between a wash and a detail?",

  {
    question: "Are ceramic coatings worth it?",
    answer: "Ceramic coatings provide long-lasting hydrophobic protection (6–12+ months), making maintenance washes easier and helping resist minor scratches and UV damage."

  },
  {
    question: "How long does a full detail take?",
    answer: "Most full details take 3–6 hours, depending on vehicle size and condition. Express or single-area details can be completed in under 2 hours."
  },

    question: "Can I do my own detailing at home?",
